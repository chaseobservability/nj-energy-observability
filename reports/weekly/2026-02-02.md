## Executive Snapshot

- **System posture:** Tight (contextual, non-forecast)
- **Peak pressure:** Up relative to recent baseline
- **Capacity exposure (descriptive):** ~$19-22 per customer-month (capacity component only)
- **Emissions in risk hours:** Marginal CO2 elevated during top-load hours (context only)
- **EO1 activity:** No new public artifacts posted this week
- **Data note:** Emissions values are illustrative placeholders pending live ingestion

## Scorecard Highlights (Zone-First)

### Load & Peak Behavior

- **AECO:** Peak load within historical range
- **JCPL:** Top-N hour intensity modestly above baseline median
- **PSEG:** Coincident peak hours more aligned with PJM system peaks than baseline
- **RECO:** No material deviation from baseline
- **Statewide:** Peak pressure trending upward relative to recent quarters

---

### Emissions in Risk Hours (Contextual)

- Marginal CO2 intensity during top-load hours appears higher than all-hours averages
- Dispersion across hours remains wide, indicating sensitivity to unit dispatch mix

*Note: Values shown are placeholders until live marginal emissions ingestion is enabled.*

---

### Affordability (Capacity-Related Exposure)

- **Capacity price anchor:** Referenced from latest public auction result
- **Estimated exposure band:** ~$19-22 per customer-month (capacity component only)
- **Interpretation:** Exposure reflects wholesale capacity dynamics, not full bills

---

## Signals -> Questions

- **Signal (Outcome):** PSEG shows higher coincidence between zone peaks and system peaks relative to baseline.  
  **Question:** Is this pattern driven by recent weather anomalies or by persistent constraint patterns visible in public PJM data?

- **Signal (Outcome):** Statewide peak pressure trending upward relative to recent quarters.  
  **Question:** How much of this change aligns with temperature-driven demand versus structural load growth?

- **Signal (Outcome):** Marginal emissions during top-load hours show elevated dispersion.  
  **Question:** Which fuel types or unit classes are setting marginal emissions during these hours in public dispatch data?

## Public Docket / Filings Delta

- **PJM:** No material public postings affecting NJ zones this week
- **FERC:** No new NJ-relevant dockets identified
- **NJ BPU:** No EO1-related orders posted this week

## Data & Traceability

- **Primary sources:** PJM Data Miner (public), NJ public orders

## Guardrails (Reminder)

This brief does not:
- forecast prices or reliability outcomes,
- recommend regulatory actions,
- evaluate utility or program performance,
- or use nonpublic data.

It is a public-data-based observability artifact.

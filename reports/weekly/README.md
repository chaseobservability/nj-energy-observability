# Weekly Briefs -- Review & Purpose

Weekly briefs are the primary **cadence artifact** of NJ Energy Observability.

They are designed to:
- maintain situational awareness,
- surface changes in public data,
- and convert signals into structured questions.

They are **not** decision documents.

## What a Weekly Brief Is

A Weekly Brief is a **public-data-based synthesis** that:
- summarizes recent system conditions,
- references published EO milestones and public filings,
- highlights notable movements in scorecarded metrics,
- and frames clarifying questions for further inquiry.

It is:
- descriptive,
- reviewable,
- reproducible.

---

## What a Weekly Brief Is Not

A Weekly Brief must not:
- forecast prices or reliability outcomes,
- recommend regulatory or policy actions,
- evaluate or rank utilities or programs,
- interpret intent or motivations,
- rely on nonpublic or confidential information.

---

## Review Standards (PR-Based)

Each Weekly Brief should be submitted via pull request.

Reviewers should check:

- [ ] All data sources are public and cited
- [ ] Metrics rendered align with `metrics/metric-catalog.yml`
- [ ] Baseline references (if used) are explicit and correct
- [ ] Language remains descriptive and neutral
- [ ] "Signals -> Questions" contain questions only, no conclusions
- [ ] EO tracker updates reference public artifacts only
- [ ] No new metrics appear without catalog registration

---

## Change Discipline

- Edits after publication should be rare and documented
- If data corrections are required:
  - note the correction clearly,
  - update the run manifest if applicable,
  - do not silently overwrite history

Weekly briefs create institutional memory.
Treat them accordingly.

## File Naming Convention

reports/weekly/YYYY-MM-DD.md

Where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the week-ending date.

---

## Why This Matters

Weekly briefs are where observability becomes durable.

They allow:
- continuity across weeks,
- accountability without enforcement,
- and clarity without overreaction.

They are intentionally boring -- and therefore powerful.

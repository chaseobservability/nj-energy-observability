# Not In Scope

NJ Energy Observability is a public-data-based observability project. Its power comes from structure, traceability, and disciplined synthesis — not from predictions or prescriptions.

This document defines what this project explicitly does not do. These exclusions are intentional and non-negotiable.

---

## 1. No nonpublic or confidential data

This project must not ingest, store, reference, or infer from:
- utility-confidential filings or discovery materials
- nonpublic market participant data
- privileged regulatory information
- internal agency deliberations
- draft or predecisional documents

Only publicly available sources are permitted.

---

## 2. No forecasts or nowcasts

This project does not:
- predict prices
- project reliability events
- estimate future shortages
- generate probabilistic outcomes
- simulate market clearing

All metrics are descriptive, not predictive.

---

## 3. No recommendations or prescribed actions

This project does not:
- recommend regulatory actions
- suggest policy choices
- rank “best” or “worst” options
- evaluate what an agency should do

The system may surface questions, not answers.

---

## 4. No performance evaluation or enforcement logic

This project does not:
- grade utilities
- score compliance
- define targets
- implement incentives
- support enforcement actions

Metrics may be scorecarded against historical baselines for context, but this does not imply judgment, accountability, or consequences.

---

## 5. No real-time alerting for market conditions

This project does not:
- send personal alerts about prices, congestion, or system stress
- provide real-time notifications that could resemble trading signals

Operational alerts are limited to data integrity issues (failed pulls, missing rows, etc.).

---

## 6. No internal note-taking or deliberation capture

This repository is not:
- a notebook for private analysis
- a log of meetings or conversations
- a place to record internal views

Sensitive thinking or deliberation must occur outside this system.

---

## 7. No implied official status

This project is not:
- an official state product
- a regulatory instrument
- an endorsed scorecard
- a substitute for formal processes

All materials must clearly state their independent, non-official status.

---

## Why these limits exist

These boundaries protect contributors and maintainers, preserve trust with regulators and utilities, and prevent misinterpretation or misuse.

Observability is powerful precisely because it stops short of control.

Any contribution that crosses these boundaries should be declined or revised.

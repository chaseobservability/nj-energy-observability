# Weekly Briefs

Weekly Briefs are the primary **cadence artifact** of NJ Energy Observability.

They provide a time-ordered, public-data-based record of how New Jersey's electricity
system conditions evolve over time.

Each brief is:
- descriptive, not prescriptive
- reproducible from public sources
- reviewed via pull request
- archived as part of the project's institutional memory

## What a Weekly Brief Contains

Each Weekly Brief includes:

- **Executive Snapshot**  
  High-level situational awareness (non-forecast)

- **Executive Order Tracking**  
  Status of EO-related milestones based on public artifacts only

- **Scorecard Highlights**  
  Zone-first descriptive metrics contextualized against baselines

- **Signals -> Questions**  
  Structured questions raised by observed changes (no conclusions)

- **Public Docket Delta**  
  Notable new public filings or postings since the prior brief

- **Traceability Section**  
  Data sources, manifests, and definition references

---

## What Weekly Briefs Do Not Do

Weekly Briefs do not:
- forecast prices or reliability outcomes
- recommend regulatory or policy actions
- evaluate utility or program performance
- use nonpublic or confidential information

They are observability artifacts, not decision documents.
